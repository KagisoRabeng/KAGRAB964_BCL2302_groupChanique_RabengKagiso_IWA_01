# Tally App Count

A tally count is being used to count. It increments the value by one by pressing the plus (+) button and decrements the value by one by pressing the minus (-) button. It begins counting at zero and goes up to ten while also counting backward to -5. When the count reaches the maximum value (-5 and 10) the buttons are disabled to let the user know that they cannot count any further.
